# Javasript-quiz

This project is an example of a short quiz that asks users questions about javaScript. It's a relatively short quiz, but questions could be added in the future.
Methods used in this project were, setInterval, JSON, MediaQuery, Flexbox, and many others. 

## Requirements:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Usage:
To use the quiz, the user must first press the Start button in the middle of the page. The user will then be presented with the first question. Depending on if the question was answered correctly or not, the user will be given a point, or if the question was not answered correctly, the timer will lose one second. After time has ran out, or all questions are answered, the user will then be prompted to enter their initials, and they will see their initials, as well as thir score, presented in the bottom of the screen. 

## Challenges:
The greatest challenge presented by this project, was getting the timer to work properly, as well as getting the scores to display in the box at the bottom. I did really enjoy creating the format with CSS, which I was struggling with in the past. I am still not a "master" by any means, but I am getting better.
